# IMDB Score Classifier

To run all of our classifiers at once and output their CSVs, run `main.py` from the root directory, and all the CSVs will be placed in the `CSVs/` directory.

Alternatively, running the main function for each individual classifier should produce some of the results and graphs seen in the final report.
